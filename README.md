# Library-Management-System-App

Librarian can manage Books and Sections, including creating, editing, and deleting them. Librarians can see
the requested books by users and have a dashboard (Stats) to see an overview of books.
Users can request all books present in the library, read them within requested days and return them, and
search for specific ones using a search bar.
